  finalizers:
    # if you delete this app by running kubectl delete -f <this file> the argo app will be deleted but
    # the real kuber app will still be running. In order to make it in sync we need a finalizer:

spec:
  # For which project we are creating this app; this is just for grouping the apps
  project: applications
  source:
    # Repo where the gitops repo exists

  # Destination cluster and namespace to deploy the application
  destination:
    # The kubernetes cluster where Argo is installed
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
    # or cluster name

    # Namespace where to deploy the application
    # The namespace will only be set for namespace-scoped resources that have not set a value for .metadata.namespace

  syncPolicy:
    automated: # automated sync by default retries failed attempts 5 times with following delays between attempts ( 5s, 10s, 20s, 40s, 80s ); retry controlled using `retry` field.
      prune: true # Specifies if resources should be pruned during auto-syncing ( false by default ).
      selfHeal: true # Specifies if partial app sync should be executed when resources are changed only in target Kubernetes cluster and no git change detected ( false by default ).
      allowEmpty: true # Allows deleting all application resources during automatic syncing ( false by default ).
    syncOptions: # Sync options which modifies sync behavior
      - Validate=false # disables resource validation (equivalent to 'kubectl apply --validate=false') ( true by default ).
      - CreateNamespace=true # Namespace Auto-Creation ensures that namespace specified as the application destination exists in the destination cluster.
      - PrunePropagationPolicy=foreground # Supported policies are background, foreground and orphan.
      - PruneLast=true # Allow the ability for resource pruning to happen as a final, implicit wave of a sync operation
    # The retry feature is available since v1.7
    retry:
      limit: 5 # number of failed sync attempt retries; unlimited number of attempts if less than 0
      backoff:
        duration: 5s # the amount to back off. Default unit is seconds, but could also be a duration (e.g. "2m", "1h")
        factor: 2 # a factor to multiply the base duration after each failed retry
        maxDuration: 3m # the maximum amount of time allowed for the backoff strategy
