          <h3>Installation</h3>
          <p>
            Install the vscode and move it to the applications finder directory. Now open the Command Palette via ⌘⇧P and type "shell command" to find: "Shell Command: Install 'code' command via
            PATH".
            <br />Execute it. <br />Now you may need to restart the laptop for this to take the effect. <br />(more info <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/39604469" target="_blank">here</a>)
          </p>

          <h3>Open vscode folder from a shortcut</h3>
          <p>
            Once we have 'code' added to PATH we can (see above) we can create a file in a directory of our choice, eg: "~/pro/". It's where we're going to keep the shortcuts.
            <br />
            The sample file may look like:
            <script type="editor" data-lang="bash">
              cd ~/work/my-project && code .
            </script>
            You can now drag that folder to the mac menu bar to have a quick access to the shortcuts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, by default by clicking the project shortcut the terminal will open and stay opened. To avoid that open the Terminal->Preferences->Profiles->Shell and change the setting When the
            shell exits: to Close if the shell exited cleanly
          </p>

          <h2>Shortcuts</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>cmd+shift+\ # toggle between closing and opening brackets</li>
            <li>cmd+` # jump between open app windows</li>
            <li>cmd+d # rename symbol</li>
            <li>ctrl+- # go back/move forward (with shift)</li>
            <li>cmd+enter # new line in the next line</li>
            <li>Fn+F12 # go to definition, then</li>
            <li>ctrl+- # to go back</li>
          </ul>
